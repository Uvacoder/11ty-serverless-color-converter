# 11ty Serverless Color Converter demo

This demo uses 11ty Serverless to create cached server-rendered pages for user generated color conversions. Yes, we could use front-end JS, but new tools demand use, right?

## Installation

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

What are some other 11ty Serverless uses we can build? [Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brob) with any ideas.
